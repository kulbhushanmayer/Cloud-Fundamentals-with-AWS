# What’s in this course?
This course offers a hands-on, step-by-step approach to mastering AWS by guiding you through the deployment and scaling of a real-world full-stack application. Starting with foundational cloud concepts, you'll gradually learn how to launch compute resources, manage storage, set up secure networking, and automate infrastructure tasks.

As you progress, you'll work with key AWS services like EC2 for virtual machines, RDS for managed databases, and S3 for scalable storage. You'll also implement Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing to ensure your application stays highly available under high traffic. Security is woven throughout the course, with practical guidance on configuring IAM roles, managing secrets with Secrets Manager, encrypting data with KMS, and securely routing traffic using Route 53.

To complete the picture, you'll use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues in real time. By the end of this course, you’ll have the skills and confidence to deploy, manage, secure, and scale applications in AWS.

# Special Note:

This course is specially designed not just to help you understand AWS concepts theoretically, but to build confidence in designing scalable and secure architectures. Throughout the course, we follow best practices wherever possible and focus heavily on hands-on learning. Every concept is demonstrated live, with real-time troubleshooting of issues as they arise, giving you exposure to real-world scenarios and practical problem-solving.
